# Task 4 Documentation

## Requirements
For this task is asked to build up an Hackerrank-like application over a distributed architecture, Task 3 monolithic application is used as starting point.

## Overview of the architecture

Since requirements ask for a distributed architecture, the original application is now splitted into different services that can be placed inside different communicating machines (in order to simplify life professor, we build a simulation of a distributed architecture so a unique docker compose is used as final artifact).
