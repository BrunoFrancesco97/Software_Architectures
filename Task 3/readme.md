### Backend Documentation
Backend documentation can be found inside each respective folder on _main_ branch, so:
- _Software_Architectures/Task 3/backend/server/_ contains a README that explains how to build and run the single image used to run the APIRest server but also it analyzes each endpoint implemented, how login was secured and a small description about SQLAlchemy, a library that allows the persistence of data between the API and the DB;
- _Software_Architectures/Task 3/backend/db/_ contains a README that explains how to build and run the single image used to run the DBMS used but also it contains a small description of the structure of our database.
