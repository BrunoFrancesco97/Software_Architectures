	\chapter*{Introduction}
	\section*{Requirements}
	Submit a pdf file with your Katas about an hackerrank-style information system.
	\section*{Description}
	The system proposed is an hackerrank-like application that should be adopted by universities or companies in order to evaluate subscribed candidates/students and also it allows them to study theory material previosly loaded inside the platform.
	\chapter*{Users}
	\section*{Type of users}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{normal user}
		\item \textbf{admin}
		\item \textbf{staff}
	\end{itemize}
	\section*{Number of users}
	We predict about 1500  normal users connected at the same time inside the platform, a small amount of them (about 50) are part of admins and staff.\\
	We also predict 20'000 total users per year subscribed to the platform, divided by normal users, admin and staff.
	
	\chapter*{Requirements}
	\section*{Requirements}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Each company or university is assigned to a channel and each one contains a variable number of courses;
		\item Staff members must handle the creation of new channels and also work as helping center so to give users the support needed;
		\item Each course is administrated by one or more admins by a control panel;
		\item Admins and users should be able to contact staff if support is needed;
		\item Courses could contain:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Theory material section;
			\item Evaluated/Non-evaluated assignments section;
		\end{itemize}
		\item Admins can add stuff (assignments, theory materials) to each section of their own courses;
		\item An assignment could contain multiple type of exercises such as one with multiple choiches, open questions, upload of a file;
		\item An assignemnt could have an expiration date;
		\item Each assignment can be saved if not finished yet and can be continued every time a user want (obviously by considering the expiration date);
		\item Coding languages supported for IT assignment are C, C++, Python and Java;
		\item Each assignment file execution must be verified on an isolated environment so to garantee security of the host platform;
		\item An assignement might have an anti-plagiarism system;
		\item Each assignment has a final report visionable from both admins and the normal user who took the exercises;
		\item An admin can view the progress of the assignments done by the normal users;
		\item Users and assignments data must be persistent;
		\item Each channel/course/assignment must have a shareable link;
		\item Application must be scalable and elastic so to prevent low performance due to an increment of users subscribed or simultaneously connected;
		\item Application must be modulable in order to have an easier maintenance;
		\item Application must be available every time is needed and also should not crash if an error happens;
		\item New updates of the platform should be easy to do and their correctness could be verified if needed;
		\item New functionality of the platform could be added in the future;
	\end{enumerate}
	\chapter*{Additional Context}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Availability and fault-tolerance are first-class concerns, also elasticity;
		\item Scalability allows the project to have a balanced cost in comparison to the performance obtained; 
		\item We think the application will be used in the future by many companies/universities so total users might go up;
		\item User-experience is a must;
		\item The project must be developed using open source/free technologies;
		\item Automated deployment system could be used;
		\item Platform should be secure;
	\end{itemize}
