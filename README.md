# Software_Architectures
Repository used to store various tasks about Software Architecture course.

Note that this course isn't focused on graphical interface but rather deals with all aspects related to the architecture of a software, so a monolithical or a distributed one, how to organize and build them, etc, thus responsiveness of Task 3 and Task 4 applications wasn't considered during the development.

IMPORTANT: Due to a bug in Safari, we have noticed that despite set-cookie header is returned correctly from the server, the browser won't set it because of the flags used for JWT token cookie (SameSite=None, Secure=True), other browsers tested (Google Chrome, Brave, Firefox) don't cause any sort of problem.
