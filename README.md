# Software_Architectures

Repository used by Group 5 in order to have a better communication :)

## Automatic build&deploy script
An easy way to automatically build and deploy the entire system is using our Python script.
Requirements:
- Python 3 or higher
- Linux or Windows system (Mac currently not supported due to lack of a Mac!)
You can simply clone this repo, cd in the repo root and launch in a terminal:
```
git clone git@github.com:BrunoFrancesco97/Software_Architectures.git
cd Software_Architectures/build-deploy/
python3 bed.py
```
Or in one line:
```
git clone git@github.com:BrunoFrancesco97/Software_Architectures.git && cd Software_Architectures/build-deploy/ && python3 bed.py
```
